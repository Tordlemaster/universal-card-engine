If a rule says to DEAL to a deck with a name which no existing deck has, automatically create the deck with that name
When a # is in a deck's name, it should be replaced with a number one more than the deck with the
highest number version of the same name

When a * is in a deck's name, perform pattern matching with it as the wildcard and present
all the options to the player (if it appears in the TURN section)
If it is present in the GAME STRUCTURE section, a random option will be chosen

CHOOSE ANY: perform any choices of action any number of times or none
CHOOSE EITHER: perform one choice of action once

DEAL source -> dest quantity
If quantity is N, then the player can make a choice of how many they want to deal

Deck flags: (S)tack/(A)rray, Face (U)p/(D)own
NEWDECK {name} {flags} {ownership/who can see it}
ownerships: UNOWNED, THISPLAYER, CHOOSEPLAYER, THISTEAM, CHOOSETEAM

CONDRESULT is checked after the action is performed, and the action is undone if the conditions are not met
CONDINIT is checked before the action is performed, and no action is performed if the conditions are not met

WINCOND(P)layer/(T)eam/(G)lobal

ActionScope trait:
Has a set of variable bindings for THISPLAYER and deck #s, etc.
List of impl Actions
Deck names are stored in Actions as strings and variables are evaluated when the Action is executed

FORPLAYERCOND (except) will check the condition for each player encountered and ignore ones that do not meet the condition
